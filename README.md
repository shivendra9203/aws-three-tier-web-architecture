 AWS Three-Tier Web Architecture
                                                          
Description
This repository provides a hands-on walkthrough for setting up a scalable, highly available three-tier web architecture using AWS services. The tutorial focuses on manually creating the essential components, including network, security, application, and database layers, to deploy a complete web application in AWS.

Audience
This guide is intended for technical professionals with a foundational understanding of AWS services, including:

VPC: Virtual Private Cloud
EC2: Elastic Compute Cloud
RDS: Relational Database Service
S3: Simple Storage Service
ELB: Elastic Load Balancer
AWS Management Console: Interface for managing AWS services

Prerequisites
To get the most out of this tutorial, you should be familiar with the following concepts:

Setting up a VPC in AWS
Launching EC2 instances
Configuring RDS databases
Creating S3 buckets
Setting up ELBs
Navigating the AWS Management Console


Architecture Overview
You can follow this image to create a web-architecture

The architecture consists of three primary tiers:

Web Tier: A load-balanced EC2 instance running a web application.
Application Tier: EC2 instances or Lambda functions that process business logic.
Database Tier: A managed RDS instance to store data.

Components:
VPC: Create a custom VPC to securely isolate the environment.
Subnets: Use public and private subnets to ensure proper isolation and security.
Security Groups: Define rules to control access between components.
ELB: Distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances in the Web Tier.
EC2 Instances: Host the web application and business logic.
RDS: Manage the database that the application relies on.
S3: Store static content (such as images, CSS, JS).

Getting Started
1. Set up VPC and Subnets
Create a custom VPC with public and private subnets. Assign appropriate route tables and ensure your private subnets have proper access to the internet (via NAT gateway).

2. Deploy EC2 Instances
Launch EC2 instances in the public subnet to handle the web application and place application layer EC2 instances in private subnets for security.

3. Configure Load Balancer
Set up an Elastic Load Balancer to distribute traffic evenly across EC2 instances in the web tier.

4. Create RDS Instance
Set up an RDS instance (preferably MySQL or PostgreSQL) to serve as the database for your application.

5. Configure Security Groups
Define security group rules to control traffic between the components, ensuring that only authorized traffic is allowed.

6. Deploy Static Content to S3
Upload any static content (e.g., images, videos) to S3 and configure the EC2 instances to pull content as needed.

7. Scaling & High Availability
Use Auto Scaling Groups for the web and application tiers to ensure high availability and scalability.

Usage
Follow the steps in the walkthrough to deploy and test the architecture in your AWS environment.
